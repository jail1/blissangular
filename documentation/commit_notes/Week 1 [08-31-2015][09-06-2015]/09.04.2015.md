##### Commit number 1 [ 9/4/2015 ] : 

1. Removed the `hello.js` file and the tests for it in the `tests/hello_spec.js`file.
2. Created new test file `scope_spec.js` and added a basic test to it.
3. Created `scope.js` file in `development/` and added a `Scope` constructor to it (a global for now). Will not be a global anymore once I implement `Dependency Injection`.
4. Started working on the `watch` function that works with `Scope`.
5. Added `$watch` and `$digest`; very primitive implementations to the `Scope` prototype. 
6. Will have to try and understand why the test fails here.
