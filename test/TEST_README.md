# In order to be able to run the tests, you will have to install PhantomJs on your machine. Be careful, because if you are on Windows, I suggest you don't install Phantom using the terminal, since it has some problems. Just download the binary and put it in your PATH. Then it should work fine. All this, in adition to installing every BDD testing tool suggested in the package.json file.
